! Heat capacity as a function of temperature
! From:
!   Williams, D. F. (2006a). “Assessment of Candidate 
!   Molten Salt Coolants for the NGNP/NHI Heat-
!   Transfer Loop,” Oak Ridge National Laboratory Report ORNL/TM-2006/69
!   For FLiNaK salt ***   
! 
!   There are no correlations for heat capacity of Potassium Chloride- Magnesium Chloride salt. There is only one constant value of
!   1.150 kJ/kg K given by Ambrosek [2010]. for KCl-MgCl_2
!
!   Taube and Ligou assumed 0.95 kJ/kg K for UCl_3 @ 983 C   
! 
!   Modified FLiNak constants to give us what we want @ nominal temperature
!   basd on published data.  Assume temperature dependence is somewhat similar
!   between salts.

! Units: [J/g-K]
