! Evalute density as functino of temperature based on correlation
!
! Correlation is of the form density(T) = a + b*T where a, b are constants

! This was done for KCl-MgCl2 salts
! 
! Valid from 1017 - 1174 K
!
! Taube and Ligou had 2.344 g/cc density @ 984 C for PuCl3
!
! Adjusted KCl-MgCl2 to better align with Taube correlation

! Input:
!       T - temperature to evaluate density at 
! Output:
!       density - evaluated conductivity at T [ g/cm^3]
