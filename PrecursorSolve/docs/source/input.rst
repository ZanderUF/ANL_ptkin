The structure of the input files is broken up into blocks with character sequences seperating the blocks
The first line in the file is a comment, this should be something meaningful to distinguish the problem from others

.. Input File DIF3D Values::

Input file structure to read in from DIF3D
------------------------------------------

Values from DIF3D can be read in and projected onto the domain in the 1D problem
Right now it reads in the power, power fraction, doppler reactivity worth, and density reactivity worth. These are all spatially dependent.  These values are integrated across the AREA specificed in the DIF3D problem. 
It will read in the values and project them up to that axial height.  For example:

Z-Coord   Power     Frac Power    Doppler      Expansion
10        0.00E+00  0.0+00        0            0   
20        1.85E+06  6.1-03        -3.31E-07   -1.02E-06
30        3.08E+06  1.0-02        -1.01E-06   -5.11E-07

This would project from locations 10 - 20 a power of 1.85E+06/(20-10).
Similalrly, from 20 - 30 a power of 3.08E+06/(30-20)

The file read in is assumed to be titled: dif3d_values.txt
It assumes the file is read in as follows:
